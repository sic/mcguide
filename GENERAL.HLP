What do you need to run the program.

First of all it is easier to explain how the program is split up.

There are two main parts to the program....

	(1) A Guide Builder Program
   and  (2) The Monte Carlo Simulation

In order to run the Monte Carlo it is first necessary to provide it with a discription 
of the guide that you are using.  This is done by constructing an input file (BR.IN) and
running it through the Guide Builder program, which generates the data files required by
MCGUIDE.
