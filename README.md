Monte Carlo Ray-tracing simulations of neutron guides and inverted geometry instruments.

History/Ackowledgements
-----------------------
This code was originally based upon MCGUIDE written by M.W.Johnson and BUILDER by K.J.Knowles.
These were initially modified by D.Martin to add more guide components, then later by me (S.I.Campbell)
to include polarisation and the final spectrometer.
